# Golf and Tennis Analysis

Over this summer (2018) I intend to work on my data analysis skills by working through a couple of papers suggested by my prof for this directed study.
The first task for the course is to manually copy and paste pga tournament info into an excel spreadsheet (it's a STATS class, not a CSC class). While it probably (definitely) would have been faster to manually work through the data as suggested, I decided to scrape the data. The tournament I chose was the 2017 US Open, but the script (once finished) will be easily adaptable to other tournaments.

Currently there are several jupyter notebooks and I am in the process of combining them into one .py file.

This is so much fun!
